    "Logistic regression is easy to understand conceptually, it is very similar to linear regression. However, logistic regression gives only linear boundary and some times that may not be very useful as the data may not be linearly separable. Training and prediction for logistic regression can be very small. Training time for logistic regression could be much smaller than the training time for decision trees or SVM.  It is very easy to control to complexity of logistic regression boundary.\n",

    "Decision trees are a little bit more complex than Logistic regression. Decision tree classifier can give a highly nonlinear boundary and it can easily overfit to the training data if one does not carefully optimize parameters such as maximum depth of a tree. Training time of the classifier will depend on the depth of the tree. We have a better control over the complexity of the decision tree classifier than the control over the complexity of SVC. \n",

SVC also ignores the outliers and maximizes the distances of observations from the classification boundary.\n",

Based on this split, we will calculate the information gain which is equal to: 1 - Sum(entropies of the two catagories). If we gain some information by splitting over that node, ie, if we classify the data based on that single question and if the data in each catagory is more \"similar\" to each other then that classification is good. We then further refine the data in each catagory by asking another question based on the other feature in our data. Again, if the data in each catagory is more similar to each other then it means that we have gained some information by splitting the data further. If we find that we have not gained any information by splitting the data, we go back and take another feature and split the data based on that feature. This is like a tree and at each node, we are creating two branchs.
